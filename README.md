My name is John Thomas Hood and I am a senior at Mississippi State University completing my bachelors in Computer Engineering. In my past time, I partake in movies, books, hanging
with friends and video games. My favorite food is anything with Cane's sauce on it. I also play the violin as another one of my hobbies.
